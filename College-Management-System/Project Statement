For my comprehensive software project, I will develop a College Management System designed
to streamline the administrative processes of student and faculty management, course
scheduling, and enrollment tracking. This web-based application will provide an intuitive user
interface for managing academic records, supported by a MySQL database for secure data
storage. The system will implement user authentication with different roles (e.g., admin, faculty,
student) using modern security protocols like bcrypt for password hashing. The platform will also
feature RESTful APIs for efficient data handling and EJS templates for dynamic views, ensuring
a smooth user experience.
